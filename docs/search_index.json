Please take a breath from coding, relax and read some poetries. Making poetries is the new making code! You need to be: - essential - versatile - elegant Here it’s me My name is rabolas, but people call me rabo. Every bio - as it should be - containsa series of personal information. In preserving this dubious convention, here are mine: I walked through endless stretches of bluebells blooming in Oxfordshire and with ducks along the Thames. Maybe it’s trivial but for me it’s a good memory I was in Kensington, not London but Cape Town, where white people are 0.3% of the population. I felt observed, but I was in good company I like numbers. Isn’t funny for someone who thinks to be a poet and a writer? At a park in Montreal a squirrel stole my lunch I’m used to read newspapers article from the end to the beginning I like listening people and I like hiding myself into the things I write Support or Contact Having troubles with all this mess? Check out my blog Litteratti or [contact me] at rabolas at gmail.com and I will help you sort it out. "],
["reflections.html", " 1 Reflections Riflessioni (the Italian original version)", " 1 Reflections Shattered mirror reflections seeded down the street along the night. Tall trees branches bare beneath my feet run clouds. And like a flower that opens the night a swatch of sky in a ray of sunshine: a sketch of light melts down the street turns into a shadow, a Flash of elsewhere. And I, who are just a reflection in this nothing copyright, another myself. An image skewed. A pebble thrown among puddles scattered my circulars horizons. Riflessioni (the Italian original version) Frantumi di specchio seminati per strada lungo la notte. Alberi altissimi dai rami scarni sotto i miei piedi corrono nuvole. E come un fiore che si apre la notte un ritaglio di cielo in un raggio di sole: uno schizzo di luce si scioglie per strada si trasforma in un’ombra, uno sprazzo d’altrove. E io, che sono solo un riflesso in questo nulla d’autore, un altro me stesso. Un’immagine obliqua. Un sassolino gettato tra pozzanghere sparse i miei circolari orizzonti. "]
