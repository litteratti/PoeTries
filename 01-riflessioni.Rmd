# Reflections {#reflections}


Shattered mirror reflections 
seeded down the street along the night.
Tall trees branches bare
beneath my feet run clouds.
And like a flower that opens the night
a swatch of sky in a ray of sunshine:
a sketch of light melts down the street
turns into a shadow, a Flash
of elsewhere. And I, who are just a reflection
in this nothing copyright, another
myself. An image skewed.
A pebble thrown among puddles scattered
my circulars horizons.
