take a breath from coding, relax and read some poetries.
Making poetries is the new making code! You need to be:
- essential
- versatile
- elegant

## Here it's me

My name is rabolas, but people call me rabo.

Every bio - as it should be - containsa series of personal information.
In preserving this dubious convention, here are mine:

 - I walked through endless stretches of bluebells blooming in Oxfordshire and with ducks along the Thames. Maybe it's trivial but for me it's a good memory
- I was in Kensington, not London but Cape Town, where white people are 0.3% of the population. I felt observed, but I was in good company
- I like numbers. Isn't funny for someone who thinks to be a poet and a writer?
- At a park in Montreal a squirrel stole my lunch
- I'm used to read newspapers article from the end to the beginning
- I like listening people and I like hiding myself into the things I write
